title: 3D Printing

## Hobby

In the beginning of 2020 I tried to print few cases for my electronics DYI projects, and I got into taste of that activity.
Since then, I bought my own printer, started modding it both on software and hardware sides.
Below are list of links of related thing for 3D printing. Majority of information I'm going to publish in my [blog](/blog).
